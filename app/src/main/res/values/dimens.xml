    Because the window insets on round devices are larger than 15dp, this padding only applies
    to square screens.

    This padding applies to both square and round screens. The total padding between the buttons
    and the window insets is box_inset_layout_padding (above variable) on square screens and
    inner_frame_layout_padding (below variable) on round screens.
